                <p>A full-time student diving into web development and cybersecurity. I love figuring out
                    how
                    things work online and keeping them safe. But I'm not just about tech stuffâ€”I'm also really into

                    creativity, I'm on a fun journey through school where I get to learn, create, and have a blast!

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <img class="denis2" src="denis2.png" alt="">
        <p>Let me tell you about my personal life. Growing up in Spain, even though I'm Romanian by
            birth, has given me a unique perspective on the world. I've always been fascinated by different cultures,
            which is why I'm currently learning Japanese. Soon, I'll be able to speak four languages fluently, and I
            couldn't be more excited about it! Back when I was in 6th form not too long ago, my favorite subject was IT.
            Specifically, I loved diving into the cyber security module during my second year. Learning about
            encryption, data management, and the importance of securing data really sparked my interest. It's amazing
            how crucial these skills are in today's digital world, and I'm eager to keep exploring and learning more
            about them.</p>

        <h4>So, currently these are the languages that I am able to speak:</h4>

        <div class="languages">

            <div class="flag1">
                <p>Romanian</p>
                <img class="imgflag" src="romania.png" alt="">
                <p>Romania will always hold a special place in my heart as my first home. Its unforgettable cuisine,
                    stunning yet straightforward landscapes, and rich culture never fail to fill me with nostalgia and
                    joy. And let's not forget the winters there - they're the best, with snow blanketing everything!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flag2">
                <p>English</p>
                <img class="imgflag" src="england.png" alt="">
                <p>I didn't move to England until I was 15 years old. Initially, it felt quite daunting to me, yet
                    incredibly thrilling at the same time, knowing I would encounter people from various nations and
                    make countless friends. And
                    indeed, I was proven correct! Since arriving here, not only has my English improved significantly,
                    but my confidence in meeting new people has soared!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flag3">
                <p>Spanish</p>
                <img class="imgflag" src="spain.png" alt="">
                <p>Having resided here for 12 years, I must say, I have developed a deep admiration for Spanish culture.
                    The Latin music, cuisine, climate, and overall charm have left an indelible mark on my life. The
                    language itself, with its beauty and romanticism, continues to captivate me endlessly. Summers here
                    are just perfect. Mixing the hot Spanish sunsets with some bachata music soothes the soul like
                    nothing else!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flag4">
                <p>Japanese</p>
                <img class="imgflag" src="japan.png" alt="">
                <p>What captivates me about Japanese culture is their boundless creativity and deep passion for art and
                    tradition. As an artist, I've found immense inspiration in anime culture, which has fueled my own
                    creativity and passion for art significantly. Additionally, I admire the Japanese language and the
                    genuine kindness shown by the people - it's simply wonderful.</p>
