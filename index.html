                <h2>Denis Vaida</h2>
                <p>I am a full-time student diving into web development and cybersecurity. I love figuring out
                    how
                    things work online and keeping them safe. But I'm not just about tech stuffâ€”I'm also really into
                    art.
                    Whether it's painting or digital design, I'm all about letting my creative side shine. Balancing
                    coding with
                    creativity, I'm on a fun journey through school where I get to learn, create, and have a blast!

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <img src="denis2.png" alt="">
        <p>Let me tell you about my personal life. Growing up in Spain, even though I'm Romanian by
            birth, has given me a unique perspective on the world. I've always been fascinated by different cultures,
            which is why I'm currently learning Japanese. Soon, I'll be able to speak four languages fluently, and I
            couldn't be more excited about it! Back when I was in 6th form not too long ago, my favorite subject was IT.
            Specifically, I loved diving into the cyber security module during my second year. Learning about
            encryption, data management, and the importance of securing data really sparked my interest. It's amazing
            how crucial these skills are in today's digital world, and I'm eager to keep exploring and learning more
            about them.</p>
